# MyResultBoard2
Monorepo for second iteration of MyResultBoard app. MRB is competition result presentation system intended for use on result screens in the competition centre. 
MRB is created by orienteering runners for orienteering events but should be modular and easily extensible for other time-based sports.

## Packages

* [MRB-Client](./packages/mrb-client) - Client side of the app (in preview version self-contained, with dependency on LiveResultat API)

## RoadMap

MyResultBoard app is in active development. While this development is not publicly accessible now, it is likely to be open sourced in the future.
Please contact me if you are interested about using latest version.
